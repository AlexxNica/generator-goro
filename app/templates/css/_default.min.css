      This filter compiles SASS, adds vendor prefixes, and minifies the CSS.
      There are other options you can use with this filter such as using GCS
      (Google Closure Stylesheets).

      This is the glue scss package loader for web standard/Maia. It doesn't
      support components other than pagination. If you'd like base skins for
      glue components, use the base skin loader shown further down.

      This loads basic skins for glue components. Many components are supported.
      The skins are very simple and you'd be expected to customize them.
      Separate each component name with a comma in the scss_glue_components
      variable.
